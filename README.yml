    title: Predicting Profitable Customers in Banking Industry
    abstract: >
        Banks often want to know the profile of their profitable
        top 1% or 20% customers looks like. Conversely they may
        also wonder what the general profile is of the customers
        in the worst 1% and 20% of profit. Based on customerâ€™s
        data variables at any given time, a good predictive model
        can predict which profit group (extremely unprofitable,
        average, extremely profitable, etc.) customers falls into.
        This helps financial institutions to better understand
        what drives the customer profit and accordingly take
        decisions to sell their products to the right customers.
        Random forest classification algorithm is used to
        achieve this goal.
