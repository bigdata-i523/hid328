a) lists only the lines between lines that start with ```


#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml
import sys

for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        found = False
        for line in f:
                s = str(line)
                if s.startswith("```"):
                        if found == True:
                                found = False
                        else:
                                found = True
                elif found == True :
                        print line

Another solution:

#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml
import sys

for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        count = 0
        for line in f:
                s = str(line)
                if s.startswith("```"):
                        count = count + 1

                elif count == 1:
                        print s
                else:
                        count = 0



b) check if the lines have a TAB in it

#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml
import sys

for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        found = False
        for line in f:
                s = str(line)
                if s.startswith("```"):
                        if found == True:
                                found = False
                        else:
                                found = True
                elif found == True :
                        if '\t' in line:
                                print line


c) read the lines as a  yaml string


#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml
import sys

for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        count = 0
        content = ''
        for line in f:
                s = str(line)
                if s.startswith("```"):
                        count = count + 1

                elif count == 1:
                        content = content + s
                elif count == 2:
                        yamlstr = yaml.load(content)
                        print yamlstr
                        count = 0
                        content = ''

d) print out the dictionary


#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import yaml
import sys

for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        count = 0
        content = ''
        for line in f:
                s = str(line)
                if s.startswith("```"):
                        count = count + 1

                elif count == 1:
                        content = content + s
                elif count == 2:
                        yamlstr = yaml.load(content)
                        #print yamlstr
                        count = 0
                        content = ''
                        print "YAML dictionary is", type(yamlstr), yamlstr
