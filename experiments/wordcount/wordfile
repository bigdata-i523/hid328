This class has a significant amount of programming assignments. One of the assignments is going to be a term project that requires programming. However it is possible to substitue the term project with an academic term paper that does not require programming. This however does not mean that you can skip the other programming assignments. Those electing doing the term paper can receive a maximum grade of an A- for the class. This class will not have any bonus projects as we want that you focus on the class assignments and make them truly outstanding.
